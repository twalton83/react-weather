# Weather App

A weather app using React, styled-components, functional components, and async/await.

NOTE: Normally, I wouldn't push a key to Github as that is unsafe and a poor practice, but given that this project is client-side only, and the API is free to use, I have made the choice to push the key. Normally, one would use dotenv or a similar method of hiding all sensitive data.
